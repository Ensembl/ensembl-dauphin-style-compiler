## Global requirements

### Python version 3

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

### Pip

pip is the package installer for Python

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

### Rustc

`rustc` is the compiler for the Rust programming language, provided by the project itself. Compilers take your source code and produce binary code, either as a library or executable.

Refer here to learn more about rustc:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/what-is-rustc.html

`Cargo` is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust communityâ€™s package registry.

Cargo usually gets shipped along with `rustc` so we may not have to install it separately.

## Backend-server requirements

### uvicorn

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.

### Data files path:

The path is configured in core/config.py in a variable called DATA_FILES where it's pulled in from .env
  

**INTERNAL ONLY**

Download an unpack the following file inside the data files directory (./example-data/data/) before starting the backend server:

`/homes/dan/datafile-upload.tar.gz`

Unpack by running:

$ `tar -xf datafile-upload.tar.gz`

Starting the backend server:

$ `./build.sh`

  
  

# Peregrine-standalone

The standalone application can be started by running the following:

$ `cargo build`

$ `./build.sh`

The server will be started and run on port `8000` on your local machine.

The port can be changed by updating it in the file `./build.sh`
