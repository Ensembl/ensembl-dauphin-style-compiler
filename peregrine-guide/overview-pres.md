## Requeirements

---

### Existing Site Observations

* Data and code evolve, making maintenance hard
* Displays are slow
* Code is complex and scary

---

### New Site Wishes

* Fast Pan and Zoom
* Replaceable technology

---

### Approach: Start After The Biology

* Capture data as *shapes* not *entities*
* Allow trivial style changes
* Allows old data to be handled well
* Removes our responsibility for science
* Separate constant "style" from variable "data"
* Compression and styling are equivalent
