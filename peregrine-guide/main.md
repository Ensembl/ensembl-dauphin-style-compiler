# Peregrine Field Manual

This field manual covers the use, maintenance, modification, and improvement of the peregrine genome browser. It is divided into sections for ease of use.

A number of decisions have been made in the design of peregrine which are at odds with currently-common approaches. These decisions laregly arise out of experience of the continuing operation and development of ensembl scientific data and web presence over a multi-decade timescale. The approach taken here is an attempt to develop an application which might survive as long and yet be considerably more flexible and less irriating. Whatever your reasons for reading this document, it is therefore at least skimming the motivation and architecture section to avoid a sense of surprise and irritation when reading the sections of direct interest.
