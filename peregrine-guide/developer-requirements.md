## Global requirements

### Python version 3

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

Installation guide: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please note that you might need to install the required python packages using the command `python3` rather than `python` if you also have Python 2 installed.

### Pip

`pip` is the package installer for Python. 

Installation guide: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

### Rustc

`rustc` is the compiler for the Rust programming language, provided by the project itself. Compilers take your source code and produce binary code, either as a library or executable.

Installation guide: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

More info: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/what-is-rustc.html

`Cargo` is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust communityâ€™s package registry.

Cargo usually gets shipped along with `rustc` so we may not have to install it separately.

Download an unpack the following file inside the data files directory (./example-data/data/) before starting the backend server:

`/homes/dan/datafile-upload.tar.gz`

Copy from `ebi-cli-001`:

$ `rsync -aWv your-username@ebi-cli-001:/homes/dan/datafile-upload.tar.gz backend-server/example_data/data/`

Unpack by running:
